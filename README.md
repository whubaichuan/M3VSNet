## About
The present Multi-view stereo (MVS) methods with supervised learning-based networks have an impressive performance comparing with traditional MVS methods. However, the ground-truth depth maps for training are hard to be obtained and are within limited kinds of scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised multi-metric MVS network, named M<sup>3</sup>VSNet, for dense point cloud reconstruction without any supervision. To improve the robustness and completeness of point cloud reconstruction, we propose a novel multi-metric loss function that combines pixel-wise and feature-wise loss function to learn the inherent constraints from different perspectives of matching correspondences. Besides, we also incorporate the normal-depth consistency in the 3D point cloud format to improve the accuracy and continuity of the estimated depth maps. Experimental results show that M<sup>3</sup>VSNet establishes the state-of-the-arts unsupervised method and achieves comparable performance with previous supervised MVSNet on the DTU dataset and demonstrates the powerful generalization ability on the Tanks and Temples benchmark with effective improvement.

## How to use
### Environment
- python 3.6.9
- pytorch 1.0.1
- CUDA 10.1 cudnn 7.5.0

The conda environment is listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/whubaichuan/M3VSNet/blob/master/requirements.txt)

### Train
* Download the preprocessed [DTU training data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDjh-_bxKKnEuz5h-HXS7EDJn59clx6V/view) (Fixed training cameras, from [Original MVSNet](https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet)ï¼Œor the Baiduyun [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sQAC3pmceyochNvnqpE9oA), the password is mo8w ), and upzip it as the ``MVS_TRANING`` folder
* in ``train.sh``, set ``MVS_TRAINING`` as your training data path
* create a logdir called ``checkpoints``
* Train MVSNet: ``./train.sh``

### Eval
* Download the preprocessed test data [DTU testing data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=135oKPefcPTsdtLRzoDAQtPpHuoIrpRI_) (from [Original MVSNet](https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet), or the Baiduyun [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sQAC3pmceyochNvnqpE9oA), the password is mo8w ) and unzip it as the ``DTU_TESTING`` folder, which should contain one ``cams`` folder, one ``images`` folder and one ``pair.txt`` file.
* in ``test.sh``, set ``DTU_TESTING`` as your testing data path and ``CKPT_FILE`` as your checkpoint file. You can find some models in the /checkpoint/. You can use the trained models to test your image.
* Test MVSNet: ``./test.sh``
